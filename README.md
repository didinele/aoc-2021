# Advent of Code 2021 ðŸŽ„

## Usage

The input for each day can be found in the `inputs/` directory. The solutions
for each day are stored in the corresponding day file in the `src/solutions/` directory.

[pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) is required for usage.

To run any of the given solutions, first make sure you have
the dependencies installed - `pnpm i`, then compile the project using
`pnpm run build`, followed by
`node --es-module-specifier-resolution=node ./dist/index.js <day> <part>`.

Optionally, if you would like to debug something, also pass `--enable-source-maps`
to `node`.
